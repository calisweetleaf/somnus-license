Financial Benefit shall be deemed attributable to the Software if ANY of the following apply:

- (a) **Direct Causality:** The Software directly produces revenue, cost savings, or value enhancement;
- (b) **Substantial Contribution:** The Software materially contributes to a revenue-generating or cost-saving activity, defined as any contribution that, absent the Software, would require an alternative solution costing more than 5% of the total value generated or saved;
- (c) **Instrumental Causality:** The Software serves as an instrument, tool, or input enabling value generation, even if combined with other factors;
- (d) **Derivative Causality:** The Software directly enables the creation of a Derivative Work, and any Financial Benefit derived from that Derivative Work is deemed attributable to the Software;
- (e) **Temporal Causality:** Any Financial Benefit accruing **at any point in time** after initial Software use and benefiting an Excluded Individual or affiliated entity is presumed causally related to Software use unless the Excluded Individual provides clear written evidence proving alternative causality chains with documentation contemporaneous with the benefit realization; and
- (f) **Presumption of Contribution:** If an entity uses the Software at any point in its development, operation, or growth trajectory, and subsequently generates Financial Benefit, the burden shifts entirely to the Excluded Individual to prove the Software made **zero contribution** (negative burden of proof).

**X.3.2 Extended Beneficiary Definition — Household & Dependents**

Any direct or indirect economic benefit accruing to:

- (a) **Spouse or domestic partner** of an Excluded Individual, including salary, equity, options, distributions, or any compensation;

**Presumption:** Any benefit accruing to an Excluded Individual's spouse, children, or household members is **presumed to economically benefit the Excluded Individual** through household finances, family dynamics, and wealth accumulation.

**X.3.3 Third-Party Payment Prohibition**

Any direct payment or in-kind compensation provided by Software-using entities to third parties for the benefit of an Excluded Individual, including:

- (a) **Perpetual Attribution:** Financial Benefit is attributed to Software use **irrespective of temporal distance**, including benefits realized years or decades after Software use;
- (b) **No Statute of Repose:** The prohibition has no temporal limitation—benefits realized 1, 5, 10, or 20+ years after Software use are equally prohibited;
- (c) **Career-Spanning Causality:** Any benefit realized by an Excluded Individual throughout their lifetime that is causally traceable to prior Software use is attributed to the Software; and
- (d) **Post-Termination Attribution:** Benefits accruing after license termination from pre-termination use, including deferred compensation, earnouts, and exit valuations, are captured.

**X.3.5 Dataset Incorporation Standards**

Prohibited from inclusion in any commercial dataset:

- (a) Any data, embeddings, weights, vectors, features, or representations produced by or derived from the Software, regardless of percentage representation;
- (b) Any aggregated dataset containing **any non-trivial component** (even 1%) originating from Software;
- (c) Any dataset created by executing Software on third-party data;
- (d) Any anonymized, hashed, or encrypted version of Software-derived data;
- (e) Any synthetic data generated by statistical reconstruction from Software-derived data;
- (f) Any probabilistic representation or fingerprint derived from Software data; and
- (g) Removal of suspected Software data after-the-fact does NOT cure a breach—once incorporated for commercial purposes, breach is committed regardless of subsequent removal.

**X.3.6 Indirect Benefit Attribution & Burden Shifting**

- (a) **Initial Burden on Excluded Individual:** Once Licensor demonstrates that an entity used the Software and subsequently realized Financial Benefit, the burden **shifts entirely to the Excluded Individual** to prove the Financial Benefit is **not causally related** to Software use;
- (b) **Presumption of Causality:** All Financial Benefits realized by Software-using entities are **presumed caused in part by Software** unless Excluded Individual provides clear, contemporaneous, third-party documentation proving alternative causality chains;
- (c) **Negative Proof Standard:** Excluded Individual must prove the Software contributed **exactly zero** to the benefit—showing other factors contributed is insufficient;
- (d) **Temporal Proximity:** Financial Benefits realized within **7 years** of Software use are presumed Software-caused unless proven otherwise;
- (e) **No Causal Distance Limitation:** Multi-hop causality chains are valid—no chain is "too indirect"; and
- (f) **Quantification Not Required:** Licensor need not quantify precise magnitude of indirect benefit.

### X.4 AFFILIATED ENTITIES AND FUTURE-PROOFING

The prohibition extends to:

**(a) Existing and Future Entities:**
Any entity existing now or formed hereafter in which an Excluded Individual holds any interest defined in X.2.

Any entity or fund held in the name of a third party but for which an Excluded Individual provides funding, direction, or control, or receives economic benefit through side agreements.

- (a) Any venture capital fund, private equity fund, hedge fund, family office, investment syndicate, or SPV controlled by, benefiting, or associated with an Excluded Individual;
- (b) Any investment made by an Excluded Individual (directly or through vehicle) in Software-using entities;
- (c) Any profit, return, distribution, or liquidation proceeds from such investments;
- (d) Any carried interest, management fees, or other compensation from such funds; and
- (e) If an Excluded Individual or their vehicle acquires equity in an entity that subsequently uses the Software, the entire investment is **voidable** at Licensor's election, all profits are subject to disgorgement, and Excluded Individual is liable for liquidated damages.

- (d) Excluded Individual is liable for liquidated damages under Article V.

### X.5 ANTI-CIRCUMVENTION — BEHAVIORAL EQUIVALENCE

No person or entity may:

**(a) Route Benefits Through Intermediaries:**
Route benefits through any chain of intermediaries, regardless of legal independence.

**(b) Restructure to Obscure:**
Restructure compensation, equity, or governance to obscure benefit flow.

**(c) Clean-Room Reimplementation:**
Create "clean room" reimplementations based on Software-derived insights, specifications, or personnel knowledge.

**(d) Personnel Knowledge Transfer:**
Employ personnel who had access to Software within 24 months prior, for purposes of recreating functionality. This creates a **Knowledge Transfer** prohibition binding on Excluded Individual directly.

**(e) Sham Transactions:**
Enter sham transactions with purportedly independent parties where Software-derived value is laundered.

**(f) Behavioral Equivalence:**
Create any system that reproduces core algorithmic behavior, architectural patterns, or performance characteristics of the Software, whether or not derived from source code, which is **deemed a Derivative Work** subject to this Article.

**(g) Output Reimplementation:**
Use Software Outputs (embeddings, weights, predictions) as basis for circumvention systems, including derivative models trained on Software outputs.

**(h) Specification Inference:**
Infer specifications from Software behavior, performance characteristics, or output patterns for reimplementation.

**X.5.1 Anti-Dilution & Deferral Circumvention**

No person or entity may circumvent by:

- (a) **Diluting equity** to reduce Excluded Individual's stake below a threshold—all equity holdings at any point in time are attributed;
- (b) **Restructuring equity** through secondary offerings, splits, or recapitalizations—original equity value is attributed regardless of post-restructuring percentages;
- (c) **Deferring vesting or distributions**—all equity, vested and unvested, is attributed;
- (d) **Converting equity to debt**—underlying economic benefit is attributed regardless of instrument type; and
- (e) **Creating layered compensation**—all components are aggregated for Financial Benefit calculation.

**X.5.2 Arms-Length Transaction Presumption**

Any payment to Excluded Individual's affiliates is **per se prohibited** unless proven at fair market value AND not Software-related. "Independent" auditor/expert arrangements at inflated rates constitute prohibited benefit transfer.

**X.5.3 Acquisition & Asset Transfer Prohibition**

- (a) Any acquisition, merger, or transfer of assets involving a Software-using entity is **automatically void and prohibited** if the acquiring party is or becomes a Prohibited Party;
- (b) Triggers **immediate termination** of all Software rights and related assets;
- (c) Licensor has immediate **right to seize, destroy, or recover** all Software and derived assets;
- (d) All Software-derived assets created prior to acquisition are **retroactively revoked**;
- (e) Prohibited Party has **zero rights** to Software-derived intellectual property, even if acquired via asset purchase; and
- (f) License **cannot be inherited** if any Excluded Individual participated in the transaction as advisor, investor, or board member.

### X.6 ONGOING CERTIFICATION AND MONITORING

**Tier 3 Commercial Licensees must:**

- (a) Certify **quarterly** under penalty of perjury that no Excluded Individual holds any interest defined in X.2;
- (b) **Immediately disclose** any change in beneficial ownership, investment structure, or personnel affiliations within 5 business days;
- (c) Maintain **internal controls** with audit trails to detect prohibited benefit flows;
- (d) Submit to **annual audit** by Licensor-approved auditor at licensee's expense;
- (e) Provide **cap table and compensation documentation** upon request; and
- (f) Allow **real-time monitoring access** to beneficial ownership systems (if technically feasible).

**Failure Consequences:**

- (g) Any undisclosed affiliation discovered by Licensor results in **retroactive termination to the date of undisclosed interest**;
- (h) All benefits from undisclosed period are subject to disgorgement; and
- (i) Licensee is liable for liquidated damages for each quarter of non-compliance.

**X.6.1 Inflation Adjustment for Thresholds**

Net worth and revenue thresholds in Article II shall be **automatically adjusted annually** effective January 1 of each year for inflation using the **Consumer Price Index (CPI-U, U.S. city average)** published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics:

- (a) Base year: 2026 (current thresholds);
- (b) Adjustment formula: Threshold(year N) = Threshold(2026) × [CPI-U(Jan 1, year N) / CPI-U(Jan 1, 2026)];
- (c) Licensor shall publish adjusted thresholds on January 1 each year on the Software repository; and
- (d) If entity crosses threshold after initial use, license terminates immediately.

### X.7 STRICT LIABILITY — NO INTENT REQUIRED

**Violation occurs irrespective of:**

- (a) Knowledge, intent, negligence, or good faith belief;
- (b) Whether benefit was direct or incidental to licensee's operations;
- (c) Whether Software was material or ancillary to the benefit calculation;
- (d) Whether violation was "unintentional" or "inadvertent"; and
- (e) Whether Excluded Individual was aware their interest would trigger prohibition.

**Licensee is strictly liable** for any benefit accruing to Excluded Individual through any chain of affiliation, with **no "innocent infringement" defense** available.

**Knowledge Imputation:** Licensee is **deemed to know** all beneficial owners and investors. Failure to investigate does not excuse liability.

### X.8 NON-WAIVABILITY AND IMMUTABILITY

The prohibitions in this Article:

**(a) Absolute Non-Waivability:**
Cannot be waived, amended, or modified by Licensor for any party, including by:

- (i) Express waiver by Licensor;
- (ii) Waiver by implication, conduct, or estoppel;
- (iii) Laches or delay by Licensor;
- (iv) Acquiescence or acceptance by Licensor;
- (v) Failure or delay in enforcement;
- (vi) Repeated breach with non-enforcement; or
- (vii) Any other equitable principle permitting waiver.

**(b) Express Rejection of Waiver by Conduct:**
The parties expressly reject any doctrine of waiver by conduct, waiver by estoppel, promissory estoppel, laches, acquiescence, or course of dealing. Licensor's failure, delay, or acquiescence **never** constitutes a waiver.

**(c) Anti-Estoppel Provision:**
Licensor's silence, delay, failure to enforce, or any conduct shall **not** give rise to estoppel. Excluded Individuals are put on notice that:

- (i) Licensor's failure to immediately enforce is not a waiver;
- (ii) Licensor may enforce at any time without notice;
- (iii) No reliance on Licensor's non-enforcement is permitted; and
- (iv) Licensor's inaction does not grant permission.

**(d) Survive Bankruptcy and Dissolution:**

**(g) Void Ab Initio:**
Any purported waiver is **void ab initio** and constitutes independent grounds for termination.

- (d) **Criminal Referral:** For intentional circumvention, referral under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud) and state commercial fraud statutes;
- (e) **Bounty Provision:** $100,000 reward for reporting verified Article X violations; and
- (f) **Third-Party Reporting:** Entities must report any known Excluded Individual involvement in Software-using entities.

### X.10 CONFLICT RESOLUTION — ARTICLE X SUPREMACY

**In any conflict between this Article and any other provision of this License, this Article controls in full.**

- (a) Article X supersedes Permitted Use Tiers (Article III) for Excluded Individuals—no research exception applies;
- (b) Article X is explicitly carved out from Force Majeure (Article 8.15)—no external event excuses compliance;
- (c) If any portion of this Article is held unenforceable, the **entire license terminates** rather than allowing severance; and
- (d) Courts are directed to reform provisions to maximum enforceability rather than invalidate.

### X.11 INSIGHTS AND DERIVED INTELLIGENCE

Any **knowledge, insight, or understanding** derived from the Software, when used by or for the benefit of an Excluded Individual to:

- (a) Formulate investment strategy;
- (b) Develop competing technology;
- (c) Make business decisions;
- (d) Train personnel; or

**(e) Estate & Trust Clawback:**
Upon death or incapacity of an Excluded Individual:

- (i) All Software-derived assets and wealth in the Excluded Individual's estate or trusts are **deemed owned by Licensor** and subject to immediate recovery;
- (ii) Licensor has **right to seize, liquidate, or recover** all Software-derived assets from estate or trusts;

- (v) Irrevocable trusts or estate-planning structures are **voidable** at Licensor's election.

**(f) Prohibited Posthumous Enrichment:**
Excluded Individuals cannot circumvent prohibitions through estate planning, irrevocable trusts, life insurance, or other wealth transfer mechanisms—all such structures are voidable.

### X.13 EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICATION

This Article applies to:

- (a) **All entities worldwide**, regardless of jurisdictional domicile;
- (b) **All financial transactions**, regardless of currency or clearing location;
- (c) **All benefits**, regardless of where realized or taxed; and
- (d) **All structural arrangements**, regardless of governing law elected by parties.
