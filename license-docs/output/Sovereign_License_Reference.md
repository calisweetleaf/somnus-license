## 1. Executive Summary: The Sovereign Boundary

### 1.1 The Philosophy of Defense

The **Sovereign Anti-Exploitation Software License v4.0 (Leviathan Enforcement Edition)** is not merely a legal instrument; it is a **cyber-kinetic defense system**. In an era where "Open Source" has been weaponized by trillion-dollar conglomerates to extract unpaid labor from independent developers, this license establishes a hard, cryptographic, and legal boundary around the Creator's intellectual property.

This license rejects the "permissive" orthodoxy (MIT, Apache 2.0) that allows corporate entities to privatize the commons. Instead, it asserts **Digital Sovereignty**: the absolute right of the Creator to determine who benefits from their work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is a LICENSE, NOT A SALE.**
> The User acquires **zero ownership rights**. Access is a revocable privilege, contingent on strict adherence to the Anti-Exploitation Framework.

### 1.2 The Anti-Capture Mechanism

The central innovation of this license is the **Anti-Capture Framework** (Articles II & X). It recognizes that traditional "Non-Commercial" clauses are insufficient against modern corporate structures that use shell companies, foundations, and "research labs" to launder commercial intent.

This license implements:

1. **Identity-Based Exclusion**: Specific individuals (e.g., S.H. Altman, E.R. Musk) and their organizations are permanently barred.
2. **Transitive Prohibition**: The ban extends to their families, trusts, and any entity they invest in.
3. **Strict Liability**: Violations do not require "intent." If money flows to a Prohibited Party, the license is breached.

### 1.3 The Three-Tier Access Model

To protect the Creator while enabling genuine open experimentation, the license partitions the world into three distinct classes:

| Tier | User Class | Rights Granted | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | **The Sovereign Individual** | Personal learning, experimentation, and self-education. | **Free** (Automatic) |
| **Tier 2** | **The Academic** | Verified research, peer-reviewed publication, and teaching. | **Free** (Automatic) |
| **Tier 3** | **The Commercial Entity** | ANY revenue generation, business use, or service deployment. | **Negotiated** (Paid) |

### 1.4 The Leviathan Enforcement Compatibility

This license is designed for **maximum enforceability**. It includes:

- **Liquidated Damages**: Pre-agreed penalties (e.g., $150,000 per work) to bypass the difficulty of proving "actual harm."
- **No "Innocent Infringement"**: Users waive defenses based on ignorance.
- **Personal Asset Clawback**: Sanctions extend to the personal estates of those who attempt to circumvent the license (Article X).

In summary, this Software is **Open functionality for the Individual, but a Closed Fortress for the Empire.**

---

## 2. Definitions & Scope: The Language of Sovereignty

### 2.1 Core Terminology

The License uses precise, battle-hardened definitions to prevent ambiguity. Unlike standard licenses where "Commercial Use" is vague, the Sovereign License defines it **by exclusion**—anything that *isn't* strictly personal or academic is Commercial.

#### 2.1.1 "The Software" (The Protected Asset)

The definition of "Software" (Article 1.2) is **omnivorous**. It covers not just the code, but the *entirety* of the project's intellectual output.

**Includes:**
- **Source Code**: `.py`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.js` files.
- **Weights & Artifacts**: Trained models, checkpoints, LoRAs, embeddings.
- **Knowledge**: Architecture diagrams, documentation, "design patterns," and "methodologies."
- **Logs**: Terminal outputs, training logs, and generated metrics.

> [!WARNING]
> **Behavioral Equivalence (1.17)**:
> The License covers **"Clean Room" implementations**. If you define a system that *behaves* exactly like the Software based on observing it, you have created a "Derivative Work" and are bound by the License. You cannot "rewrite it in Rust" to bypass these terms.

#### 2.1.2 "Financial Benefit" (The Poison)

"Financial Benefit" (1.4, 9.3) is the trigger for Commercial status. It is defined broadly to catch modern "growth-first" business models that don't generate immediate revenue.

**It includes:**
- **Direct Revenue**: Sales, subscriptions.
- **Valuation Growth**: Increasing the stock price or VC valuation.
- **Cost Savings**: Using the software to do a job faster (time = money).
- **Data Harvesting**: Using the software to generate training data for *other* models.
- **Reputation**: "Clout" that leads to future investment.

#### 2.1.3 "Service Deployment" (The SaaS Ban)

Article 1.5 explicitly bans **"As-A-Service"** use without a commercial license. This is the **Anti-SaaS Clause**.

**Prohibited Service Architectures:**
- **REST APIs**: Wrapping the code in FastAPI/Express and selling access.
- **Cloud Hosting**: Deploying it on AWS/GCP for internal team use.
- **Discord Bots**: Public-facing bots that wrap the functionality.
- **Background Workers**: Using it as a hidden processing engine for a larger app.

### 2.2 The "AI" Definition (Article 1.8)

The License explicitly recognizes "Artificial Intelligence" not just as code, but as **Cognitive Automation**.
- **Scope**: LLMs, Transformers, Diffusion Models, Reinforcement Learning agents, and "Hybrid Systems."
- **Implication**: If you use this Software to *train* an AI (e.g., generating synthetic data), that is a restricted activity (Article 4.5).

### 2.3 "Prohibited Party" vs. "Excluded Individual"

| Term | Definition | Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prohibited Party** (2.3) | A corporation or entity listed in the "Wall of Shame" (OpenAI, Google, etc.). | Cannot use the software. Period. |
| **Excluded Individual** (1.14, X.2) | A specific human being (Altman, Musk, etc.). | **Radioactive.** If they touch it, or benefit from it, the "Nuclear" liabilities of Article X trigger. |

> [!NOTE]
> The distinction matters because a **Prohibited Party** is a corporate entity (which can be dissolved), but an **Excluded Individual** is a biological person. The ban follows the person *forever*, across any company they start, join, or invest in.

---

## 3. The Anti-Capture Framework: Defense Against the Dark Arts

### 3.1 The "Wall of Shame" (Article 2.3)

The License explicitly designates certain entities as **hostile actors** to the Sovereign ecosystem. These entities have demonstrated a pattern of enclosing the commons, lobbying for regulatory capture, or exploiting open-source labor without reciprocity.

#### The Blacklist

The following entities (and their subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors) are **PROHIBITED** from accessing the Software:

- **The "ClosedAI" Cartel**: OpenAI (Altman/Sutskever), Anthropic (Amodei), SSI.
- **The Surveillance Capitalists**: Google (DeepMind), Meta (FAIR), Amazon (AWS), Apple.
- **The Hardware Monopolies**: NVIDIA.
- **The Corporate State**: Microsoft.
- **The "X" Ecosystem**: Elon Musk's companies (Tesla, xAI, Twitter/X, Neuralink).

> [!CAUTION]
> **Total Supply Chain Ban (2.5)**
> If you work for these companies, you cannot use this software **even on your personal time** if there is any risk of knowledge transfer. You cannot use it to "upskill" for your job at Google.

### 3.2 Article X: The Nuclear Option

Article X ("Prohibited Personal Enrichment and Absolute Beneficiary Exclusion") is the most radical component of the License. It is designed to pierce the corporate veil and attach liability to specific human beings.

#### 3.2.1 The "Radioactive Man" Principle

If an **Excluded Individual** (defined in X.2) receives *any* benefit from the layout, the License is breached.
- **Standard**: Strict Liability (No intent required).
- **Scope**: Direct revenue, stock appreciation, or even "Informational Benefit" (learning a strategy).

#### 3.2.2 The "Family & Trust" Piercing (X.3.2)

Wealthy individuals often hide assets in trusts or transfer them to family members. Article X explicitly captures:
- **Spouses & Children**: Benefits flowing to the household are attributed to the Individual.
- **Trusts & Foundations**: If the Individual is a beneficiary or trustee, the Trust is tainted.
- **Investment Vehicles**: If they are an LP in a VC fund, that fund cannot invest in companies using this Software without triggering liability.

#### 3.2.3 Retrospective & Perpetual Causality (X.3.4)

The License rejects the concept of "Time".
- **Retrospective**: If you use the Software *now*, and 10 years later an Excluded Individual buys your company, the License claims that value.
- **Perpetual**: The prohibition never expires.

### 3.3 Investment Poisoning (Poison Pill)

This framework acts as a "Poison Pill" for startups.
If a startup uses this Software, they **cannot take investment** from:

1. **Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)**
2. **Sequoia Capital**
3. **Founders Fund**
4. **Khosla Ventures**
5. **Y Combinator**

**Why?** Because these funds are heavily invested in the Prohibited Parties (OpenAI, etc.). Article 2.4 extends the ban to them to prevent indirect value capture.

> [!TIP]
> **Due Diligence for Startups**
> Before using this Software, a startup must audit its Cap Table. If it has taken money from a16z or YC, it is **statistically likely** to be in breach of Article 2.4.

---

## 4. The Tiered Licensing Model: From Individual to Empire

### 4.1 The Core Principle: "Means-Tested Access"

The License rejects the binary of "Open vs. Closed" source. Instead, it adopts a **Means-Tested Access Model**. Your rights depend entirely on your **Economic Power** and your **Intent**.

#### 4.1.1 Tier 1: The Sovereign Individual (Automatic License)

This is the default state for most hobbyists and students.

**Eligibility Criteria (All Must Be True):**

1. **Income Limit**: Personal annual income < $50,000 USD.
2. **Wealth Limit**: Personal net worth < $100,000 USD.
    - **Inflation Adjustment (X.6.1):** These thresholds adjust annually based on the **CPI-U (U.S. Consumer Price Index)**. If inflation rises, the limit rises. Check the repository for the current year's adjusted numbers.
3. **Prohibited Party Status**: You are NOT an employee, contractor, or affiliate of a Prohibited Party.
4. **Intent**: Strictly personal learning, education, or non-commercial experimentation.

**Usage Rights:**
- You can read the code.
- You can run the code locally.
- You can modify the code for your own use.
- **LIMITATION**: You cannot share it, host it publicly, or use it for work.

#### 4.1.2 Tier 2: Academic & Research (Automatic License)

Designed for universities and non-profit labs.

**Eligibility Criteria:**

1. **Affiliation**: Accredited educational institution or non-profit research org.
2. **Publication Requirement**: You MUST publish your results in peer-reviewed venues or publicly.
3. **No Commercialization**: You cannot spin out a startup from this research without a commercial license.
4. **Funding Transparency**: You must not be funded by Prohibited Parties (e.g., no "OpenAI Research Grants").

**Usage Rights:**
- Same as Tier 1, plus:
- Right to publish papers citing the software.
- Right to teach courses using the software.

#### 4.1.3 Tier 3: Commercial Use (Negotiated License)

**ANYTHING ELSE IS COMMERCIAL.**

If you are:
- A startup with funding.
- A freelancer making money.
- A corporation using it internally.
- Generating revenue, cost savings, or *any* economic benefit.
- **Exceeding the Tier 1 income limits ($50k/$100k).**

**Requirements:**

1. **Mandatory Contact**: You MUST email `<treyrowell1826@gmail.com>`.
2. **Written Contract**: A separate commercial license agreement is required.
3. **Pricing Sovereignty (3.4)**: You do not get to set your own Terms of Service. The Licensor retains veto power over your pricing to prevent you from gouging users.

> [!WARNING]
> **No Implied Rights**
> If you do not fit Tier 1 or Tier 2, and you do not have a signed Contract for Tier 3, **YOU HAVE NO LICENSE.** Your use is Copyright Infringement.

---

## 5. Operational Restrictions: The "Service Deployment" Ban

### 5.1 The Anti-SaaS Doctrine (Article 1.5 & 4.2)

The Sovereign License fundamentally prohibits **Rent-Seeking Behavior**. The most common form of modern rent-seeking is **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**—wrapping a library in an API and charging specifically for access.

**Article 4.2 (CRITICAL PROHIBITION)**
You cannot:
- **Host**: Put the software on a server accessible to others (public or private).
- **Wrap**: Create an API, SDK, or library wrapper that exposes its functionality.
- **Embed**: Put it inside a hardware device or appliance sold to others.
- **Process**: Use it as a backend worker (e.g., Celery task) for a customer-facing app.

> [!NOTE]
> Even if the service is **free** or **internal-only**, if it "processes requests from parties other than yourself," it is a **Service Deployment** and is **Prohibited**.

### 5.2 The AI Training Prohibition (Article 4.5)

This License recognizes that **Data is the new Uranium**. It strictly controls how the Software interacts with the AI ecosystem.

**You CANNOT:**

1. **Train**: Use the Software's code or outputs to train, fine-tune, or distillation of a model.
2. **Generate Data**: Use the Software to create a dataset (synthetic data generation) for commercial AI.
3. **Feed the Beast**: Allow Github Copilot, Gemini, or any "AI Assistant" to scan the codebase. (You must configure your `.gitignore` and editor settings to prevent this).
4. **Benchmark**: Use the Software to evaluate or test other commercial models.

**The "Fruit of the Poisonous Tree" Doctrine:**
Any model trained on data generated by this Software is permanently tainted. It cannot be commercialized, and its weights are subject to the same restrictions.

### 5.3 Reverse Engineering & Reimplementation (4.4, 4.6)

The License anticipates attempts to bypass it by "rewriting" the code.

**Prohibited Actions:**
- **Clean Room Design**: Observing the software's behavior to write a clone.
- **Porting**: Translating from Python to Rust/C++.
- **Refactoring**: Changing variable names or structure to hide origin.
- **Decompiling**: Reverse-engineering the binary.
- **Bypassing TPMs**: Removing license checks or watermarks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Behavioral Equivalence (1.17)**
> If you build a system that *does the same thing* based on your knowledge of this Software, you are in breach. Determining "sameness" is at the sole discretion of the Licensor.

## 6. Enforcement Protocols: The Leviathan

### 6.1 The "Strict Liability" Standard (Art. X.7)

Unlike most civil contracts where you argue about "intent" or "mistakes," this License operates on **Strict Liability**.
- **Did you do it?** Yes.
- **Are you liable?** Yes.
- **Did you mean to?** Irrelevant.

This removes the "Innocent Infringement" defense. If you execute the code, you accept the liability.

#### 6.1.1 The "Negative Proof" Burden Shift (X.3.6)

In a dispute, the License **reverses the burden of proof**.

1. **Licensor Shows Use**: The Licensor only needs to show that you used the Software and subsequently made money.
2. **Burden Shifts**: You must then prove that the Software made **exactly zero contribution** to that income.
3. **7-Year Presumption**: Any financial benefit realized within **7 years** of using the Software is legally presumed to be caused by the Software. You must disprove this with contemporaneous documentation.

### 6.2 The Liquidated Damages Schedule (5.3)

Because proving "actual financial harm" for software is difficult, the License establishes **Pre-Agreed Penalties**. By using the software, you agree that these amounts are reasonable estimates of the damage caused.

#### The Breakdown (USD per Incident)

| Offense | Penalty | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unauthorized Commercial Use** | **$100,000** | Basic breach. |
| **Service Deployment (SaaS)** | **$500,000** | Per deployment instance. |
| **AI Model Training** | **$1,000,000** | Per model trained. |
| **Article X Violation** | **$5,000,000** | **The Nuclear Option.** Per quarter. |
| **Prohibited Party Use** | **$2,000,000** | E.g., OpenAI employee use. |

> [!WARNING]
> **Cumulative Penalties**
> These stack. If you are an OpenAI employee (Prohibited Party) who trains a model (AI Training) and deploys it as an API (Service Deployment), your liability is:
> $2M + $1M + $500k = **$3.5 Million USD per incident.**

### 6.3 Enhanced Statutory Damages (5.4)

In addition to the contract damages above, the Licensor can elect **Copyright Damages**.
- **Willful Infringement**: Up to **$150,000 per work infringed**.
- **Attorney's Fees**: You pay the Licensor's legal bills (5.7).

### 6.4 Injunctive Relief (No Bond)

Most lawsuits require a "bond" to stop someone from doing business. This License forces you to waive that right. The Licensor can get a court order to **shut down your servers immediately** without putting up cash.

### 6.5 Jurisdiction and Venue

* **Law**: State of **Alabama**.
- **Venue**: Northern District of Alabama or Etowah County Courts.
- **Arbitration**: **Solely at Licensor's Option** (JAMS). You cannot force arbitration; the Licensor can force you into it or drag you to court.

### 6.6 Article X: The "Nuclear" Enforcement

Article X includes explicitly non-severable, non-waivable enforcement logic.
- **Immutability**: The Licensor cannot even *waive* Article X for you. It's designed to be legally "hard-coded."
- **Clawback**: Proceeding against the **Estate and Trust** of an Excluded Individual. This means liability follows the money into family trusts.

| **I deployed it on AWS for my team** | $500k + Injunction | **Severe** |
| **I trained a Lora on it** | $1M + Model Deletion | **Critical** |
| **I am a VC and I invested in a user** | Investment Voided + $2M | **Nuclear** |

### 7.3 Compliance Certification (Tier 3)

For Commercial Licensees, the following must be certified quarterly:

1. **Cap Table Audit**: No Excluded Individuals on the Cap Table.
2. **Beneficial Owner Check**: No "Related Economic Interests" (spouses/trusts) of Excluded Individuals.
3. **Use Audit**: No Service Deployment without explicit permission.
4. **Revenue Report**: Accurate disclosure of gross revenue for pricing adjustments.

> [!TIP]
> **When in doubt, email.**
> The only way to cure a potential breach or "gray area" usage is to get a written Commercial License.
> **Contact**: `<treyrowell1826@gmail.com>`
