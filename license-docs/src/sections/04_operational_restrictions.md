# Operational Restrictions: The "Service Deployment" Ban

## 5.1 The Anti-SaaS Doctrine (Article 1.5 & 4.2)
The Sovereign License fundamentally prohibits **Rent-Seeking Behavior**. The most common form of modern rent-seeking is **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**—wrapping a library in an API and charging specifically for access.

**Article 4.2 (CRITICAL PROHIBITION)**
You cannot:
*   **Host**: Put the software on a server accessible to others (public or private).
*   **Wrap**: Create an API, SDK, or library wrapper that exposes its functionality.
*   **Embed**: Put it inside a hardware device or appliance sold to others.
*   **Process**: Use it as a backend worker (e.g., Celery task) for a customer-facing app.

> [!NOTE]
> Even if the service is **free** or **internal-only**, if it "processes requests from parties other than yourself," it is a **Service Deployment** and is **Prohibited**.

## 5.2 The AI Training Prohibition (Article 4.5)
This License recognizes that **Data is the new Uranium**. It strictly controls how the Software interacts with the AI ecosystem.

**You CANNOT:**
1.  **Train**: Use the Software's code or outputs to train, fine-tune, or distillation of a model.
2.  **Generate Data**: Use the Software to create a dataset (synthetic data generation) for commercial AI.
3.  **Feed the Beast**: Allow Github Copilot, Gemini, or any "AI Assistant" to scan the codebase. (You must configure your `.gitignore` and editor settings to prevent this).
4.  **Benchmark**: Use the Software to evaluate or test other commercial models.

**The "Fruit of the Poisonous Tree" Doctrine:**
Any model trained on data generated by this Software is permanently tainted. It cannot be commercialized, and its weights are subject to the same restrictions.

## 5.3 Reverse Engineering & Reimplementation (4.4, 4.6)
The License anticipates attempts to bypass it by "rewriting" the code.

**Prohibited Actions:**
*   **Clean Room Design**: Observing the software's behavior to write a clone.
*   **Porting**: Translating from Python to Rust/C++.
*   **Refactoring**: Changing variable names or structure to hide origin.
*   **Decompiling**: Reverse-engineering the binary.
*   **Bypassing TPMs**: Removing license checks or watermarks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Behavioral Equivalence (1.17)**
> If you build a system that *does the same thing* based on your knowledge of this Software, you are in breach. Determining "sameness" is at the sole discretion of the Licensor.
