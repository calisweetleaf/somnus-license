# The Tiered Licensing Model: From Individual to Empire

## 4.1 The Core Principle: "Means-Tested Access"
The License rejects the binary of "Open vs. Closed" source. Instead, it adopts a **Means-Tested Access Model**. Your rights depend entirely on your **Economic Power** and your **Intent**.

### 4.1.1 Tier 1: The Sovereign Individual (Automatic License)
This is the default state for most hobbyists and students.

**Eligibility Criteria (All Must Be True):**
1.  **Income Limit**: Personal annual income < $50,000 USD.
2.  **Wealth Limit**: Personal net worth < $100,000 USD.
    *   **Inflation Adjustment (X.6.1):** These thresholds adjust annually based on the **CPI-U (U.S. Consumer Price Index)**. If inflation rises, the limit rises. Check the repository for the current year's adjusted numbers.
3.  **Prohibited Party Status**: You are NOT an employee, contractor, or affiliate of a Prohibited Party.
4.  **Intent**: Strictly personal learning, education, or non-commercial experimentation.

**Usage Rights:**
*   You can read the code.
*   You can run the code locally.
*   You can modify the code for your own use.
*   **LIMITATION**: You cannot share it, host it publicly, or use it for work.

### 4.1.2 Tier 2: Academic & Research (Automatic License)
Designed for universities and non-profit labs.

**Eligibility Criteria:**
1.  **Affiliation**: Accredited educational institution or non-profit research org.
2.  **Publication Requirement**: You MUST publish your results in peer-reviewed venues or publicly.
3.  **No Commercialization**: You cannot spin out a startup from this research without a commercial license.
4.  **Funding Transparency**: You must not be funded by Prohibited Parties (e.g., no "OpenAI Research Grants").

**Usage Rights:**
*   Same as Tier 1, plus:
*   Right to publish papers citing the software.
*   Right to teach courses using the software.

### 4.1.3 Tier 3: Commercial Use (Negotiated License)
**ANYTHING ELSE IS COMMERCIAL.**

If you are:
*   A startup with funding.
*   A freelancer making money.
*   A corporation using it internally.
*   Generating revenue, cost savings, or *any* economic benefit.
*   **Exceeding the Tier 1 income limits ($50k/$100k).**

**Requirements:**
1.  **Mandatory Contact**: You MUST email `<treyrowell1826@gmail.com>`.
2.  **Written Contract**: A separate commercial license agreement is required.
3.  **Pricing Sovereignty (3.4)**: You do not get to set your own Terms of Service. The Licensor retains veto power over your pricing to prevent you from gouging users.

> [!WARNING]
> **No Implied Rights**
> If you do not fit Tier 1 or Tier 2, and you do not have a signed Contract for Tier 3, **YOU HAVE NO LICENSE.** Your use is Copyright Infringement.
