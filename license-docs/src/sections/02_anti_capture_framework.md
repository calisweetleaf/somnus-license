# The Anti-Capture Framework: Defense Against the Dark Arts

## 3.1 The "Wall of Shame" (Article 2.3)
The License explicitly designates certain entities as **hostile actors** to the Sovereign ecosystem. These entities have demonstrated a pattern of enclosing the commons, lobbying for regulatory capture, or exploiting open-source labor without reciprocity.

### The Blacklist
The following entities (and their subsidiaries, affiliates, and successors) are **PROHIBITED** from accessing the Software:

*   **The "ClosedAI" Cartel**: OpenAI (Altman/Sutskever), Anthropic (Amodei), SSI.
*   **The Surveillance Capitalists**: Google (DeepMind), Meta (FAIR), Amazon (AWS), Apple.
*   **The Hardware Monopolies**: NVIDIA.
*   **The Corporate State**: Microsoft.
*   **The "X" Ecosystem**: Elon Musk's companies (Tesla, xAI, Twitter/X, Neuralink).

> [!CAUTION]
> **Total Supply Chain Ban (2.5)**
> If you work for these companies, you cannot use this software **even on your personal time** if there is any risk of knowledge transfer. You cannot use it to "upskill" for your job at Google.

## 3.2 Article X: The Nuclear Option
Article X ("Prohibited Personal Enrichment and Absolute Beneficiary Exclusion") is the most radical component of the License. It is designed to pierce the corporate veil and attach liability to specific human beings.

### 3.2.1 The "Radioactive Man" Principle
If an **Excluded Individual** (defined in X.2) receives *any* benefit from the layout, the License is breached.
*   **Standard**: Strict Liability (No intent required).
*   **Scope**: Direct revenue, stock appreciation, or even "Informational Benefit" (learning a strategy).

### 3.2.2 The "Family & Trust" Piercing (X.3.2)
Wealthy individuals often hide assets in trusts or transfer them to family members. Article X explicitly captures:
*   **Spouses & Children**: Benefits flowing to the household are attributed to the Individual.
*   **Trusts & Foundations**: If the Individual is a beneficiary or trustee, the Trust is tainted.
*   **Investment Vehicles**: If they are an LP in a VC fund, that fund cannot invest in companies using this Software without triggering liability.

### 3.2.3 Retrospective & Perpetual Causality (X.3.4)
The License rejects the concept of "Time".
*   **Retrospective**: If you use the Software *now*, and 10 years later an Excluded Individual buys your company, the License claims that value.
*   **Perpetual**: The prohibition never expires.

## 3.3 Investment Poisoning (Poison Pill)
This framework acts as a "Poison Pill" for startups.
If a startup uses this Software, they **cannot take investment** from:
1.  **Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)**
2.  **Sequoia Capital**
3.  **Founders Fund**
4.  **Khosla Ventures**
5.  **Y Combinator**

**Why?** Because these funds are heavily invested in the Prohibited Parties (OpenAI, etc.). Article 2.4 extends the ban to them to prevent indirect value capture.

> [!TIP]
> **Due Diligence for Startups**
> Before using this Software, a startup must audit its Cap Table. If it has taken money from a16z or YC, it is **statistically likely** to be in breach of Article 2.4.
